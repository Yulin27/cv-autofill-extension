# Extension Icons

## Quick Setup

To generate the icons for this extension:

### Option 1: Use the Icon Generator (Recommended)
1. Open `create-icons.html` in your browser
2. Right-click each canvas image
3. Select "Save image as..."
4. Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` in this folder

### Option 2: Create Your Own Icons
Create three PNG images with the following specifications:

- **icon16.png**: 16x16 pixels
- **icon48.png**: 48x48 pixels

Design suggestions:
